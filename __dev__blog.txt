14-07-2025 to 24-07-2025:
  ->Experimenting with building own file systems and learn about ata command ports and about 32 bit mode.
  ->Planning the course of the project and setting temporary milestones.

25-07-2025:
  ->Starting the actual project, Booted the OS and Entered the 32 bit Protected Mode.
  ->Made 2 Helper functions like print(), clear_screen();

26-07-2025:
  ->made many helper functions and functions like mem which is equivalent of malloc which made the development process easy;
  ->made a ram based custom file-system(inlcuding directories) with tree like custom designed structure.
  ->have options like create,delete,list,write,read.etc...

27-07-2025:
  ->since the ram based system is not persistent ,tried to make it disk based but failed.
  ->rewritten the entire code to make it disk based and written few extra helper functions too.
  ->the rewritten code is in such a way that i dont have to rewrite it in order to make updates again.

Critical Challenge:
 ->converting entire code into disk.(27-07-25)
